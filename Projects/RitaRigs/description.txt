Rita Rigs
---
A visual identity rebranding project for an online educator, RitaRigs, complete with a cohesive visual set of graphics for both livestreams and on-demand video content. Rigging as a skill often involves many small technical steps, creating friction for beginners and making it feel intimidating, rigid, and unforgiving. This new brand identity was designed to soften that experience: sharp, disciplined geometry reflecting the structure of the craft, while soft lighting and gentle gradients introduce warmth and approachability. The layered forms reinforce depth and clarity, reframing rigging as a skill that becomes accessible with patience, structure, and guidance. 

In collaboration with animator, Daniel Silva, and programmer, Dominik Lingenover.
