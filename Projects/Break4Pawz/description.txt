Break 4 Pawz
---
Love On 4 Paws, an animal assisted therapy organization, had visited our campus to share the joy, comfort and healing power of their wonderful therapy dogs. Students who were looking for a break from the stress of the new school year were welcomed to stop by to enjoy a therapy dog’s unconditional love. Representatives from the Mind Matters Initiative, Student Health Advisory Committee, Student Health Center and Dean of Students Office were available to share information and resources to help participants navigate the demands of academic excellence, family responsibilities, and jobs. Resources provided were to support students in getting their mind, body and soul ready for a successful semester.
