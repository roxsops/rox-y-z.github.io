Still I Rise, Ending Violence Against Womn
---
Rooted in inclusivity, this campaign embraced the spelling ‘womn’ to ensure all survivors felt represented. Created for Domestic Violence Awareness Month, the initiative supported a series of educational, healing, and empowerment‑focused events across the University‑Student Union. This design focused on honoring survivors, highlighting available resources, and encouraging community engagement. The graphics balanced sensitivity with strength, reinforcing the campaign’s mission to uplift, inform, and inspire action.
