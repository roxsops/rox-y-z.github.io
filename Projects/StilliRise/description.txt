Still I Rise, Ending Violence Against Womn
---
This campaign was created to support Domestic Violence Awareness Month through a series of educational, healing, and empowerment‑focused events hosted across the University‑Student Union. It adopted the spelling, ‘womn,’ to align with its inclusive values. My design work for this campaign focused on honoring survivors, highlighting educational resources, and encouraging community engagement across all events. The graphics balanced sensitivity with strength, supporting the campaign’s mission to uplift, inform, and inspire action.
