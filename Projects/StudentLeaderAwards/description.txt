Student Leader Awards

Campaign design for The Student Leader Awards of 2018 at California State University, Los Angeles. This annual ceremony recognizes and celebrates the many activities, events and contributions of on-campus student organizations, members and advisers. To reflect the focus on leadership for this ceremony, the golden eagle side-profile design was positioned on one side. This is to lead the eye in relation to any text it resides next to.
