CalvaryChapel
---
Calvary Chapel in Prineville, Oregon, desired a logo that reflects the landscapes connected to their ministry. Barnes Butte, a landmark in their own community, and Makalu Mountain in Nepal’s Himalayan Range, together illustrate the far-reaching paths taken to carry the gospel. At the heart of the design, Mount Zion emerges through negative space, symbolizing the Lord’s presence and the unity of His people across distant lands.
