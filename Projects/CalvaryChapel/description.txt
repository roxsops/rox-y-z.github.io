CalvaryChapel

Calvary Chapel, located in Prineville, Oregon, sought out a logo that represented landscapes they traverse. Barnes Butte, local to their area in Prineville, and Makalu Mountain, located among the Himalayan Range in Nepal, both sharing the lengths followers will go to share the gospel. Mount Zion is represented in the center of the logo using negative space, symbolizing its presence and unifying the lands.
